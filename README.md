# Congress-api

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.

This app was an introduction to api usage.  This app pulls data from a public congressional site and allows the user to query the data using ember-cli, jquery and javascript.  there was an error in the websites api which made us have to revert to jsonp for a couple queries.
